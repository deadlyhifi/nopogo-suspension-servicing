          <p>
            RockShox and Fox recommend a service every 50-100 hours of riding.
            It’s pretty muddy ’round here so err on the side of caution – give
            it the once over regularly. We can do that for you hassle free.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drop off your fork, go back to your normal life, pick up your fork.
            Ride.

          <p>
            Bring your own seals and we’ll fit them as part of the service, or
            we can supply SKF.
          </p>

          <p>We use high quality Motul or genuine RockShox and Fox oils.</p>

          <p>
            If we discover something more sinister we’ll get your approval
            before going ahead with new parts.

            These prices assume you’ve removed the fork from your bike and
            washed it. A £5 <em>"look at the state of that"</em> charge applies
            if I have to frown when you hand the fork over.
